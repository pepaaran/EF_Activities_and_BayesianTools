## The Bayesian setup

`BayesianSetup` is the central object from the package. This class contains information about the model to be fit (likelihood) and the priors of the model parameters. A `BayesianSetup` object is created with the `createBayesianSetup` function, which expects a log-likelihood and (optional) a log-prior, then creates the posterior and functions for the samplers.
